# 🌐 Social Media UI Clone

Hey there! 👋  
This project is a simple front-end clone of a social media platform — kind of like a mini Facebook. It's built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, just for fun and practice.

The idea was to recreate the look and feel of a social feed with a profile page, stories section, post interface, and even a dark mode toggle. No backend here — it’s all static and focused on UI.
